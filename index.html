    <h1>CANA Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <h2>1. What is CANA?</h2>
    <p>CANA ($CANA) is a cultural movement that bridges blockchain technology with real-world products. It combines physical items (like streetwear and collectibles) with NFTs to create verifiable, one-of-a-kind ownership experiences.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How do RWA-Backed NFTs work?</h2>
    <p>Each CANA NFT represents a physical product. When you mint or buy one, you receive both a digital NFT in your wallet and the corresponding physical item with a unique QR code linking them on-chain.</p>
    
    <h2>3. What products can I own as RWA-Backed NFTs?</h2>
    <p>CANA offers streetwear, apparel, lifestyle gear, and limited-edition collectibles. Each product is tied to an NFT that proves authenticity and ownership history.</p>
    
    <h2>4. What is the "One-of-One Protocol"?</h2>
    <p>Before reselling a CANA NFT, you must destroy the physical product and submit video proof. This ensures only one physical item exists per NFT at any time, maintaining rarity.</p>
    
    <h2>5. How does the Destruction Protocol work?</h2>
    <p>1. Record a video clearly showing the product's destruction (with QR code visible)<br>
    2. Submit it via CANA Marketplace<br>
    3. Wait for verification before reselling the NFT</p>
    
    <h2>6. What happens when I resell my CANA NFT?</h2>
    <p>You receive 50% of the resale value. The other 50% funds a brand-new physical product for the buyer, tied to the same NFT. The original item is destroyed to preserve uniqueness.</p>
    
    <h2>7. How does the QR code system work?</h2>
    <p>Each physical product has a unique QR code that:<br>
    - Links to its NFT on the blockchain<br>
    - Shows ownership history<br>
    - Prevents counterfeits<br>
    - Enables resale with automatic royalties</p>
    
    <h2>8. Can I use CANA products in digital worlds?</h2>
    <p>Yes! CANA is developing integrations with gaming/metaverse platforms to let you equip avatars with your NFT-linked physical items (like hoodies or sneakers).</p>
    
    <h2>9. What benefits do NFT holders get?</h2>
    <p>- Early access to new drops<br>
    - Time-based perks for long-term holders<br>
    - In-game boosts (when integrated)<br>
    - 50% resale royalties<br>
    - Exclusive events/airdrops</p>
    
    <h2>10. Where can I buy/sell CANA NFTs?</h2>
    <p>The official CANA Marketplace will handle all transactions, including:<br>
    - Verified resales<br>
    - Destruction verification<br>
    - Automatic royalty splits (50/50 between seller and CANA)</p>
    
    <h2>11. What blockchain does CANA use?</h2>
    <p>Currently on TON (as a meme coin), with plans for:<br>
    - A dedicated Layer-2 chain on TON for NFTs<br>
    - Multi-chain deployment (Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)</p>
    
    <h2>12. How is CANA different from other NFT projects?</h2>
    <p>CANA uniquely ties NFTs to physical items with enforced scarcity (via destruction), real utility (wearable products), and circular economics (50% resale royalties).</p>
    
    <h2>13. What happens if my physical product is damaged?</h2>
    <p>If the QR code is intact, it remains verifiable. If destroyed, you can initiate the resale process (with destruction proof) or contact support for edge cases.</p>
    
    <h2>14. Can I transfer my NFT without destroying the item?</h2>
    <p>No. The physical product must be destroyed before transferring the NFT to maintain the one-of-one guarantee. This is enforced by smart contracts.</p>
    
    <h2>15. How does CANA prevent counterfeit QR codes?</h2>
    <p>Each QR code is:<br>
    - Cryptographically tied to the NFT<br>
    - Recorded on-chain at minting<br>
    - Invalidated after destruction<br>
    - Scannable to show full history</p>
    
    <h2>16. What's CANA's long-term vision?</h2>
    <p>To create a circular economy where:<br>
    - Every physical product has digital twin<br>
    - Ownership is provable and valuable<br>
    - Resales fund new creations sustainably<br>
    - Culture is co-owned by the community</p>
    
    <h2>17. Will there be a DAO?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Future plans include decentralized governance where NFT holders can vote on:<br>
    - Product designs<br>
    - Partnerships<br>
    - Treasury allocations</p>
    
    <h2>18. How do I verify authenticity before buying?</h2>
    <p>Always:<br>
    1. Scan the QR code to check blockchain records<br>
    2. Confirm the NFT matches the physical item<br>
    3. Buy only through official CANA channels</p>
    
    <h2>19. What if I don't want to destroy my item?</h2>
    <p>You can keep it forever! The Destruction Protocol only applies if you choose to resell the NFT. Physical ownership doesn't expire.</p>
    
    <h2>20. How can I join the CANA community?</h2>
